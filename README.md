# Nordcraft Documentation

This repository contains the official documentation for [Nordcraft](https://nordcraft.com), a visual web development engine for building web applications.

## Documentation Website

You can find the published documentation at: [https://docs.nordcraft.com](https://docs.nordcraft.com)

## Structure

The documentation is organized into numbered sections and pages, with each page in its own folder containing an `index.md` file and related assets:

```text
docs/
  01-about-nordcraft/
    index.md
    image1.webp
    image1-large.webp
  02-use-cases/
    index.md
  ...
  18-guides/
    01-component-creation-guide/
      index.md
    99-contribution-guide/
      index.md
```

The numbering system determines the order in which sections and pages appear in the navigation.
