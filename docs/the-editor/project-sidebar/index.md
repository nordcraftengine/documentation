# Project sidebar

The project sidebar provides an overview of your project, including any issues detected in your project, and changes made in the current branch you are working in.

1. **Files**: View all files, components, services, actions, formulas, media, themes and settings in your project
2. **View and install packages**: Browse, search for, and install Nordcraft packages
3. **Issues**: View issues found in your project and get advice on how to fix them (an orange dot is visible when issues are detected)
4. **Source control**: View any changes made in the current branch of your project

### Content sections

Each section can be expanded or collapsed and includes a [kbd]+[kbd] button to create new items (except for themes and settings):

- [Pages](/pages/overview): View and manage all pages in your project
- [Components](/components/overview): Access all reusable components in your project
- [Services](/connecting-data/services): Configure API connections to external services with an OpenAPI specification
- [Actions](/actions/overview): Create and manage global actions that can be used throughout your entire project
- [Formulas](/formulas/project-formulas): Define project formulas for calculations and logic that can be accessed from any page or component
- [Media](/media/overview) Upload and manage image files for your project
- [Themes](/styling/theme): Configure design tokens including colors, spacing, and typography
- **Settings**: Manage project configurations like favicon, robots.txt, sitemap, app manifest and service worker

## Project settings

At the bottom of the files view of the project sidebar, you can configure the following settings for your project:

- **Favicon**: Upload a [favicon](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Favicon) for your project - available at `/favicon.ico`
- **Robots.txt**: Target a custom [robots.txt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Robots.txt) document (with a URL) - available at `/robots.txt`
- **Sitemap.xml**: Target a custom [sitemap.xml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps) document (with a URL) - available at `/sitemap.xml`
- **App Manifest**: Target a custom [manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest) JSON file (with a URL) - available at `/manifest.json`
- **Service Worker**: Target a javascript file url for a script that registers a [service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers). The script will be available on `/serviceWorker.js`. To serve the actual service worker, you need to create a [proxy](/pages/proxies) to the URL where the service worker script is hosted. The service worker registration script could also be used to include a custom script on all pages of your project. See a reference implementation of using a service worker in [this project](https://editor.nordcraft.com/projects/service_worker_example/branches/main/routes/my-service-worker?canvas-width=800&canvas-height=800&rightpanel=style)
