# Create an app in toddle

This guide will teach you how to create a new app in toddle and help you understand the project structure.

## Create a new app

1. Log in to your toddle account at [toddle.dev](https://toddle.dev/login).
   - When logged in, you'll see all your projects and two buttons at the top, "New app" and "New package."
   - Click the button that says "New app."

2. You'll be presented with a choice of templates. You can either:
   - Choose a pre-made template for specific types of projects
   - Select "Blank Template" to start from scratch

3. After selecting your template, toddle will automatically create a project for you and load the editor.

## The Project Structure

You'll need to understand the structure before you build in the toddle editor. Here's a brief overview of the app structure:

1. **Pages**: Your app starts with a main page (usually named "Home"). You can add more pages as your app grows.

2. **Components**: Reusable elements you can create and use across your app.

3. **Assets**: This is where you manage any media files (images, videos, etc.) used in your app.

4. **APIs**: If your app needs to interact with external data sources, such as a backend, you can set up API connections here.

5. **Variables**: These allow you to store and manage data within your project.

**Note:** You can access and manage these different aspects of your app using the sidebar or hit escape to reveal the right-hand sidebar with all your app settings.

## Next Steps

You can build highly performant web apps now that you've created your app! Here are some next steps:

1. Explore the [Toddle Editor](/getting-started/toddle-editor) to familiarize yourself with the interface.
2. Learn how to [Edit Your Application](/getting-started/edit-application) to start adding content and functionality.
3. When you're ready, learn how to [Preview and Publish](/getting-started/preview-and-publish) your application.
