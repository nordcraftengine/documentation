# Element tree

The element tree provides a structural overview of your project, displaying all elements and componenents in your page or component hierarchically.

## Navigation and selection

- Elements are named according to their HTML tag or component name
- Toggle visibility of child elements using the triangle icon to collapse sections
- Select elements by clicking on them, just as in the canvas
- Drag elements to reorder them within the structure

::: info
HTML element names always correspond to their actual HTML element tag.
:::

::: tip
Hold the [kbd]Alt[kbd] key while dropping a dragged element to copy it instead of moving it.
:::

## Context menu

Right-clicking an element opens a context menu with several actions.

1. **Add element**: Opens the element catalog
2. **Wrap in element**: Place the element inside a new parent element
3. **Extract as component**: Convert the element into a reusable component
4. [Show/hide](/formulas/show-hide-formula): Set a formula to control element visibility
5. [Repeat](/formulas/repeat-formula): Apply a formula to create multiple instances from an array
6. **Standard operations**: Duplicate, cut, copy, paste and delete

## Add a new element

Add a new element in one of three ways:

- select [kbd]Add element[kbd] from the context menu
- click the [kbd]+[kbd] button in the sidebar header
- use the shortcut [kbd]I[kbd] to open the element catalog

## Element catalog

![Element catalog|16/9](element-catalog.webp){https://editor.nordcraft.com/projects/docs_examples/branches/main/components/screenshot-page?rightpanel=style&canvas-width=800&canvas-height=800&selection=nodes.m6MApQ1ZZSiZ5iH6kAUWE&elementCatalog=true}

The element catalog provides a collection of HTML elements and components organized by category. This makes it easy to find exactly what you need for your project. The catalog allows you to:

- Browse different element types grouped by functionality
- Search for specific elements and components
- View components from installed packages

Select an element to add it to your project. The element will be added as a child of the currently selected element or as the first child of the root element if no element is selected.

::: tip
The Nordcraft element catalog contains the most commonly used HTML elements. To add an element that is not listed in the catalog, add any element, and edit its `Tag` under `Attributes` in the Right panel.
