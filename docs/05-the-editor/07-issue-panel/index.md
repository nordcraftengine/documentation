    - Expandable sections with a complete list of issues for each component/page
    - A badge indicating the number of issues in each section

# Issue details
Each issue includes:
- Descriptive title
- Detailed description of the issue
- Severity level (info, warning, error) shown via icon

Click on an issue to navigate directly to its location in your project.
