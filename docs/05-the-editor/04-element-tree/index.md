# Element tree
The element tree provides a structural overview of your project, displaying all elements in your page or component hierarchically. It enables efficient navigation, selection and organization of your project's building blocks.

- Select elements by clicking on them, just as in the canvas
- Drag elements to reorder them within the structure

The element catalog provides a comprehensive collection of HTML elements and components organized by category. This makes it easy to find exactly what you need for your project. The catalog allows you to:
- Browse different element types grouped by functionality
- Search for specific elements and components
- View components from installed packages

Select the needed element to add it to your project. The element will be added as a child of the currently selected element or as the first child of the root element if no element is selected.
