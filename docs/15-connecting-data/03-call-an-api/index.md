# Call an API

After [configuring an API](/connecting-data/working-with-apis), you need to trigger the call and access the returned data.

There are two ways to trigger API calls:

1. [Auto fetch](#using-auto-fetch): Automatically calls the API on load or when dependencies change
2. [Workflow actions](#using-workflow-actions): Manually trigger the API from workflows

## Using auto fetch

Auto fetch automatically calls your API without requiring manual triggers. This is particularly useful for data that should be loaded immediately when a component appears.

![Use API auto fetch|16/9](use-auto-fetch.webp)

To enable [auto fetch](/connecting-data/working-with-apis#auto-fetch-behavior):

1. Navigate to your API in the [data panel](/the-editor/data-panel)
2. Toggle **Auto fetch** on
3. Optionally use a formula for conditional fetching

## Using workflow actions

Workflow actions give you precise control over when APIs are called, typically in response to user interactions or other events.

![Use API workflow action|16/9](use-api-workflow-action.webp)

To call an API from a [workflow](/workflows/working-with-workflows):

1. Create or edit a workflow for an event
2. Click [kbd]+[kbd] to add an action
3. Under **APIs**, select your API
4. (Optional) Specify any input values you want to override, as defined in the API

## API example

The following example demonstrates how to implement a weather card that combines both API calling methods. It uses auto fetch to load weather data when the component mounts and provides a update button that manually triggers the API through a workflow action.

This weather card displays the current temperature, and the `Update` button allows you to manually refresh it.

# API inputs

API inputs let you customize parameters each time you call an API, giving you flexibility to reuse the same endpoint with different values depending on the context.

![Configure API inputs|16/9](configure-api-inputs.webp)

Define inputs for your API:

1. Click [kbd]+[kbd] in the **Inputs** tab
2. Set a name
3. Set a default value, either static or dynamic using the [kbd]fx[kbd] button

When calling the API through a [workflow action](#using-workflow-actions), all defined inputs become available for overriding.

::: info
Unlike test values which are only used during development, input values serve as actual default values when the API is called with auto-fetch enabled.

# Handling API callbacks

Callbacks are events triggered by API responses, letting you execute specific workflows.

![Handle API callbacks|16/9](handle-api-callbacks.webp)

Available callbacks:

1. **On success**: Triggered when the API call is successful
2. **On error**: Triggered when the API call fails
3. **On message**: Triggered when a message is received

Set up callback handling in the **Events** section of the API or workflow action.

::: dev
Callback events on the API are executed just before the action-specific events.
:::

The following example demonstrates how to configure and react to an API callback event.

@@@ example
componentUrl: https://docs_examples.toddle.site/.toddle/custom-element/example-handle-api-callback.js
editorUrl: https://toddle.dev/projects/docs_examples/branches/main/components/example-handle-api-callback?canvas-width=800&rightpanel=events&selection=workflows.AMb8F4.actions.0.onSuccess&canvas-height=800
height: 21rem

When the weather data is successfully updated, a confetti animation is triggered as feedback.

# Accessing API data

Once your API call completes, the resulting data is available for use in your application's logic and UI.

![Access API data|16/9](access-api-data.webp)

Access API response in the [formula editor](/formulas/overview#the-formula-editor):

1. In the formula editor, add a new node and select the API endpoint from the **APIs** section
2. Select the data you want to use

Available API response data:

- `isLoading`: Indicates if the API call is in progress
- `data`: Contains the successful API response body
- `error`: Holds error information if the API call failed
- `response`: Provides HTTP response details:
  - `status`: HTTP status code
  - `headers`: Response headers
  - `performance`: Performance metrics

::: tip
Use `isLoading` to manage UI states during data fetching (e.g. showing loading indicators, disabling interactions).
