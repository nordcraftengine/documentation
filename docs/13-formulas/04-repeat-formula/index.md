# Repeat formula

The repeat formula allows you to create multiple instances of an element based on a set of data. This enables dynamic lists, grids and other repeating UI structures.

The repeat formula:

- Creates a new instance of an element for each item in a data array
- Makes the current item available as `Item` within the repeated element
- Automatically updates when the data changes
- Can be applied to any element or component

## Using the repeat formula

![A repeat formula is visible in the formula editor. Blue fx buttons next to repeat and repeat key on the right attributes panel show that both the repeat and repeat key formulas are active. The visible repeat formula shows that the selected component in the HTML element tree is repeated based on data from the _CARDS variable. The _CARDS variable is an array, and as such, the demo card is repeated for every element in the _CARDS array.|16/9](add-a-repeat-formula.webp 'Add a repeat formula'){https://editor.nordcraft.com/projects/docs_examples/branches/main/components/example-repeat-formula?canvas-width=800&rightpanel=attributes&selection=nodes.nQgi8KJ7OPxn9l5H0mML-.repeat&canvas-height=800}

To create dynamic content with the repeat formula:

1. Select the element you want to repeat
2. In the [attributes tab](/the-editor/element-panel#attributes-tab), click the [kbd]fx[kbd] button next to **Repeat**
3. Enter a formula that returns an `Array`; the element will be repeated for each item in the array
4. Set a [Repeat key](#optimizing-performance-with-the-repeat-key)

::: info
The output of your repeat formula must be iterable (an `Array` of items).

### Accessing data in repeated elements

Within repeated elements, you can access:

- `Item`: The current item from the array
- `Index`: The position of the current item (starting from 0)

These repeat item variables allow you to customize each instance based on its data and position.

## Creating numeric ranges

If you want to repeat an element a specific number of times without dynamic data, you can use the `Range` formula. This is useful for pagination, grid layouts or any situation where you need a specific number of repeated elements.

See how you can generate multiple cards using the Range formula.

## Optimizing performance with the repeat key

To ensure efficient updates and tracking of repeated elements, add a **repeat key** formula that generates a unique identifier for each item. This key helps Nordcraft track items efficiently, preventing re-renders and improving performance. Use a stable value like a database ID, unique property or composite key (e.g. `list-item-{id}`) for seamless updates when data changes.

::: warning
Using the index as a key prevents Nordcraft from making optimizations. Use a unique identifier, like a database ID or content hash. Duplicate keys disable performance optimizations.
:::

### How the repeat key improves performance

The repeat key formula improves performance of your application in several ways:

- Enables Nordcraft to track specific items across renders
- Allows reuse of DOM elements instead of recreating them
- Prevents unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged items
- Maintains element state when items change position

This is especially important when:

- Working with large data sets
- Implementing drag-and-drop reordering
- Frequently updating or filtering data
- Adding or removing items from the middle of a list
