# Projects in toddle
A project in toddle can be either an **app** or a **package**.
## Apps
These projects are full applications used for web development, including web apps, websites and more. Since toddle is built on standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can create anything from simple pages to complex interactive experiences.

See here for [creating an app](/get-started/create-a-project#create-an-app).
## Packages
Packages are modular, self-contained collections of components or functions that can be used across multiple apps. They help keep your projects organized by separating reusable elements and logic. Packages are public, allowing other users to install and integrate them into their own projects.

See here for [creating a package](/get-started/create-a-project#create-a-package).

It's not possible to use packages in packages.
