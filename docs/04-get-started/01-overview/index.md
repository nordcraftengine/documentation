# Get started with Nordcraft
Nordcraft provides a flexible and intuitive development environment for building applications.

# Dashboard
![Dashboard|16/9](dashboard.webp)

The Nordcraft dashboard includes those key sections:

1. **Start building**: Quick action to start a [new project](/get-started/create-a-project) or solve challenges to explore Nordcraft features
2. **Recent activity**: Quick access to your most recently edited projects
3. **All projects**: View and manage projects from all of your organizations

# Projects in Nordcraft
A project in Nordcraft can be either an **app** or a **package**.

## Apps
These projects are full applications used for web development, including web apps, websites and more. Since Nordcraft is built on standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can create anything from simple pages to complex interactive experiences.

See here for [creating an app](/get-started/create-a-project#create-an-app).

## Packages
Packages are modular, self-contained collections of components or functions that can be used across multiple apps. They help keep your projects organized by separating reusable elements and logic. Packages are public, allowing other users to install and integrate them into their own projects.

See here for [creating a package](/get-started/create-a-project#create-a-package).

::: info
It is currently not possible to use packages in packages.
:::

::: dev
Packages in Nordcraft work similar to NPM packages. They can contain pure logic, visual elements or both.
