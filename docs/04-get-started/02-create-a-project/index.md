## Create a project from the dashboard
In the dashboard view, you will find the **Start Building** section. Click [kbd]Create app[kbd] or [kbd]Create package[kbd] to begin the creation process for the corresponding project type.

## Create a project from the organization view
In the organization view, at the top right of the project list, you will find the buttons to create an app or a package. Click on the relevant button to start the process.

# Visibility options
When creating a project you can choose between two options:
- **Public**: Your project will be visible and clonable via a link, but others cannot edit it.
- **Private**: Your project is only visible within your organization, with customizable access and roles for different users.

::: info
Private apps require a paid plan and it is currently not possible to make packages private.
