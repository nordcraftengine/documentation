# Create a project
Creating a new project in Toddle is simple and quick. Whether you are starting an app or a package, follow the steps below to get started.

## Create a project from the dashboard
In the dashboard view, you will find the **Start Building** section. Click `Create app` or `Create package` to begin the creation process for the corresponding project type.

## Create a project from the organization view
In the organization view, at the top right of the project list, you will find the buttons to create an app or a package. Click on the relevant button to start the process.

# Create an app
To create an app, follow these steps:
1. **Select organization**: The organization is pre-selected based on your account settings.
2. **Choose visibility**: Decide who can see your app and select public or private. (Note: Private apps require a paid plan)
3. **Choose a template**:
   - Blank Template: Start with a fresh, empty app.
   - Toddle Template: Choose from available toddle templates.
   - Community Template: Pick from community-contributed templates.

After selecting the template, you will be directed to the editor to start working.

# Create a package
To create a package, follow these steps:
1. **Choose organization**: The organization is pre-selected based on your account settings.
2. **Select an emoji**: Choose an emoji to represent your package.
3. **Enter name**: Type in the desired name for your package.
4. **Adjust project id**: The id is automatically generated based on the package name, but you can adjust it as needed.

After confirming the details, the package will be created and you will be taken to the editor to start working on it.

# Visibility options
When creating a project you can choose between two options:
- **Public**: Your project will be visible and clonable via a link, but others cannot edit it.
- **Private**: Your project is only visible within your organization, with customizable access and roles for different users.
