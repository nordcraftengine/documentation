# AI Assistant

In Nordcraft you get access to your very own AI Assistant that understands the context of your projects and knows how to build for the web. The AI Assistant is also trained on the Nordcraft documentation and videos.

## Open the AI Assistant

You can access the AI Assistant by clicking the "Ask AI" button on the bottom bar, or by using the keyboard shortcut [kbd]Cmd/Ctrl[kbd]+[kbd]I[kbd]. The AI Assistant opens to the right of the editor, allowing you to continue to work alongside it.

The Ask AI button on the bottom bar is hovered over, which shows it having a lighter grey background than the grey background of the bottom bar.|16/9](ai-assistant.webp 'AI Assistant')

## What can the AI do?

The AI can perform a number of tasks to help you understand and build projects in Nordcraft. You can choose between 2 modes:

### Ask mode

When in Ask mode the AI can perform the following tasks:

- **Answer Nordcraft questions**: it can explain features, concepts, and best practices when building in Nordcraft
- **Search documentation**: it can find specific information from Nordcraft's official documentation
- **Analyze your project structure**: it can examine your current components, pages, workflows and other elements, and give you information on their functionality and advise about next steps
- **Provide implementation tips**: it can explain approaches and direct you to the right tools for building features

:::info
Using Ask mode is free of charge.

### Build mode

When in Build mode the AI can also help you build your project. This includes building and updating pages, components, workflows, formulas, and styling.

#### Using build mode

When you ask the AI for changes in build mode, you will enter `Preview mode`.

1. See a list of created or edited files above the input field in the AI panel.
2. Navigate through the changes proposed by the AI using the top bar.
3. Choose to accept or reject the proposed changes currently visible.

Build mode uses a credit system. You get a number of free credits each day, and if you need more credits, you can purchase them directly from inside the Nordcraft editor.

The amount of credits used depends on the model you chose and the complexity of the task. You can select between the following models:

| Model           | Cost   | Best use case                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemini 3 Flash  | 💰     | Most build tasks.                                                                      |
| Gemini 3 Pro    | 💰💰   | Task analysis. Use this mode when Flash has problems finding and fixing annoying bugs. |
| Claude Opus 4.6 | 💰💰💰 | UI design and well-styled components                                                   |

:::tip
In Build mode you can also attach an image to your request, such as a screenshot of a design. The AI will use this image when analyzing your request but cannot insert it directly into the design.

## What the AI can't do

While the AI Assistant in Build mode can propose changes for your project, it cannot apply those changes directly. You must review and manually accept or reject each suggestion, ensuring you maintain full control over your project.

Additionally, the AI cannot currently:

- **Create or read services created in Nordcraft**
- **Upload or read media files in Nordcraft**

The Nordcraft AI is currently in Beta. New features will be added and current features are subject to change.
