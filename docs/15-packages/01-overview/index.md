# Browsing packages
The packages panel organizes available packages into three tabs:
- **Popular**: Most frequently installed packages
- **Newest**: Recently published packages
- **Installed**: Packages currently used in your project

Use the search bar to find specific packages.

# Package details
Click on any package to view its detailed information page, that includes:
- Documentation explaining the package's purpose and functionality
- Live interactive examples demonstrating key features
- Instructions for using components, actions and formulas
- Details about available attributes, events and configurations
- Implementation examples and use cases

You can give a star to packages you find useful by clicking the star icon next to the install button. Stars contribute to the package's ranking in the Popular tab. 

Additionally, you can clone any package by clicking the `clone` button, which creates a copy of the package in your account that you can modify.
