# Create a new project in Nordcraft

In Nordcraft, you can create an [app](/get-started/overview#apps) or a [package](/get-started/overview#packages).

## Create a project from the dashboard

In the dashboard view, find the **Start Building** section. Click [kbd]Create app[kbd] or [kbd]Create package[kbd] to begin the creation process for the corresponding type of project.

When you select a template, the Nordcraft editor will open for you to start working.

1. **Choose organization**: The organization is pre-selected based on your account settings
2. **Enter name**: Choose a name for your package
3. **Edit package ID**: The package ID is automatically generated based on the package name, but you can edit it as needed

Click `Create package` to open the Nordcraft editor and start building.

For more detailed instructions on packages, see the [creating and launching packages](/packages/creating-and-launching) guide.

## Visibility options

When creating a project you can choose between two visibility options:

- **Public**: Your project will be visible and clonable via a URL, but others cannot edit it
- **Private**: Your project is only visible within your organization, with customizable access and roles for different users

::: info
Private apps require a paid plan.
It is currently not possible to create private packages.
