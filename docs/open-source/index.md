# Toddle Open Source

We're excited to announce that Toddle is on the path to becoming open-source! This marks a significant milestone in our journey to revolutionize how software is built for the web.

## Our Vision for Open Source

At Toddle, we believe in the power of open collaboration and the incredible potential it holds for innovation. By going open-source, we're not just sharing our code; we're inviting you to be a part of shaping the future of web development.

### Why Open Source Matters

Open-source software is at the heart of every computer system you interact with daily. It powers the servers that render web pages, the devices you use, and the browsers you rely on. Without open-source software, the web as we know it wouldn't exist.

### Toddle's Commitment

From July 2024, we will begin the work to make Toddle open-source. This decision reflects our commitment to:

1. **Accessibility**: Making powerful web development tools available to everyone.
2. **Transparency**: Allowing developers to understand and trust the tools they use.
3. **Community-Driven Innovation**: Harnessing the collective creativity of developers worldwide.
4. **Freedom**: Giving you true ownership and control over your applications.

## What This Means for You

- **Greater Control**: Build and run your Toddle applications anywhere, without being locked into a specific platform.
- **Customization**: Adapt Toddle to your specific needs by modifying the source code.
- **Contribution Opportunities**: Help improve Toddle and shape its future development.
- **Learning**: Gain insights into how a powerful visual programming platform is built.

## Our Roadmap to Open Source

We're approaching this transition in phases. Check out our [Open Source Roadmap](roadmap.md) for more details on our plans and progress.
