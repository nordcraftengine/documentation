# Packages

Packages extend your Nordcraft projects with reusable components and functionality. They help you save development time and maintain consistency across projects.

# Browsing packages

You can find the [kbd]packages[kbd] button in the [left sidebar](/the-editor/overview#left-panel). The packages panel organizes available packages into three tabs:

- **Popular**: Most frequently installed packages
- **Newest**: Recently published packages
- **Installed**: Packages currently used in your project

Use the search bar to find specific packages.

# Package details

Click on any package to view its detailed information page, that includes:

- Documentation explaining the package's purpose and functionality
- Live interactive examples demonstrating key features
- Instructions for using components, actions and formulas
- Details about available attributes, events and configurations
- Implementation examples and use cases

You can give a star to packages you find useful by clicking the star icon next to the [kbd]install[kbd] button. Stars contribute to the package's ranking in the Popular tab.

Additionally, you can clone any package by clicking the [kbd]clone[kbd] button, which creates a copy of the package in your account that you can modify.
