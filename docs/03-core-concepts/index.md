# Nordcaft core concepts

Nordcraft is built around several fundamental concepts that form the foundation of the Web Development Engine. Understanding these core concepts will help you work more effectively with Nordcraft before you begin your first project.

## Visual development with code foundation

Nordcraft combines visual development with a solid code foundation. This hybrid approach means:

- You can build visually while the system generates clean, optimized code
- Visual changes are reflected immediately in the interface
- Complex interactions can be implemented using visual development through [workflows](/workflows/overview)
- Custom code can be added when needed for specialized functionality

This approach bridges the gap between visual design tools and coding environments, eliminating traditional handoffs between designers and developers, and removing the time-consuming setup processes of traditional development environments.

Explore [the editor](/the-editor/overview) to see how this works in practice.

## Component-based architecture

Nordcraft is built and optimized around using a [component-based architecture](/components/overview) in your projects:

- **Components** are reusable, self-contained pieces of interface and functionality
- Each component has its own structure, [styling](/styling/styles-and-layout) and behavior
- Components can be [composed together](/components/compositions) to create more complex interfaces
- Components maintain encapsulation of their internal state and logic

This component-based approach promotes reusability, maintainability and collaboration among team members. Learn how to [create your own components](/components/create-a-component) to build a modular application.

## Projects: apps and packages

Nordcraft organizes work into [two main project types](/get-started/create-a-project):

- **Apps** are complete applications with pages and functionality
- **Packages** are collections of reusable components and functions

[Packages](/packages/overview) can be published and shared across projects, making them ideal for common functionality. Learn more about [creating and launching packages](/packages/creating-and-launching) to share your work.

## Branches and version control

Nordcraft includes built-in version control through its [branching system](/get-started/branches-and-publishing):

- The `main` branch represents the live version of your project
- Create new branches for developing features or fixes
- [Preview changes](/get-started/branches-and-publishing#preview-a-branch) before publishing
- Branches are [published to main](/get-started/branches-and-publishing#publish-changes) when work is complete

This git-like workflow enables collaboration and maintains stability in your projects. For best practices, check out our guide on [effective branching](/good-practices/branching) strategies.

## Pages and navigation

[Pages](/pages/overview) form the foundation of applications in Nordcraft:

- Each page has a unique [URL path](/pages/page-configuration#url-structure)
- Pages can accept [parameters](/pages/static-and-dynamic#dynamic-pages) for dynamic content
- Pages contain [components](/building-blocks/components) and [elements](/building-blocks/elements)
- [SEO metadata](/pages/page-configuration#metadata) is configured at the page level

The page structure creates the overall navigation framework for your application. Learn how to [create pages](/pages/create-a-page) and set up their configuration.

## Data flow and reactivity

Nordcraft uses a reactive data model built on signals:

- [Variables](/variables/overview) store state within components and pages
- [Formulas](/formulas/overview) transform data through pure functions
- [Workflows](/workflows/overview) implement interactive behavior
- [Contexts](/contexts/overview) share data between components
- When data changes, the interface updates automatically

This reactive approach ensures your interface stays in sync with underlying data. Learn about [working with variables](/variables/working-with-variables) and [creating formulas](/formulas/working-with-formulas) to implement dynamic behavior.

## Server and client rendering

Nordcraft supports both server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR):

- SSR improves initial page load speed and is essential for search engine optimization (SEO)
- CSR enables rich interactivity after the initial page load
- The Nordcraft Web Development Engine intelligently handles the transition between these modes

This hybrid rendering approach provides the best of both worlds for performance and user experience.

When [working with APIs](/connecting-data/working-with-apis), you can [configure which requests are processed during SSR](/connecting-data/advanced-api-features#server-side-rendering-ssr) or whether they are processed on the client after the initial page has loaded.

## API integration

External data is connected through the [API integration system](/connecting-data/overview):

- [Configure endpoints](/connecting-data/working-with-apis) to connect to any backend
- Handle [authentication](/connecting-data/authentication) securely
- Transform and use [response data](/connecting-data/call-an-api#accessing-api-data) in your interface
- Set up real-time data with [streaming connections](/connecting-data/streaming)

The API interface in Nordcraft forms the bridge between your frontend and any backend services. You can also connect to specialized backend providers through [services](/connecting-data/services).

::: tip
These core concepts appear throughout the Nordcraft documentation. As you work with the platform, you will develop a deeper understanding of how these concepts interact to create a powerful web development environment.
