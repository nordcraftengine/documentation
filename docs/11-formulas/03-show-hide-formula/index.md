# Show/hide formula

The show/hide formula allows you to conditionally render elements based on specific conditions. This enables you to create dynamic interfaces that respond to user interactions, application state and other factors.

The show/hide formula controls whether an element is displayed or not:

- It evaluates a `Boolean` expression
- If the expression is truthy, the element is shown
- If the expression is falsy, the element is hidden
- The formula is applied by setting the `show` attribute on an element

::: dev
The truthy concept in Nordcraft is similar to JavaScript but follows a more streamlined approach:

- Only `false`, `null` and `undefined` are treated as **falsy**
- All all other values (including empty strings, zero and empty arrays) are considered **truthy**

## Add a show/hide formula

![Add a show formula|16/9](show-hide-formula.webp){https://toddle.dev/projects/docs_examples/branches/main/components/example-show-hide-formula?canvas-width=800&rightpanel=attributes&selection=nodes.nQgi8KJ7OPxn9l5H0mML-.condition&canvas-height=800}

To conditionally show or hide an element:

1. Select the element you want to show and hide based on conditions
2. In the [attributes tab](/the-editor/element-panel#attributes-tab), click the [kbd]fx[kbd] button next to **Show**
3. Enter a formula that evaluates to a `Boolean` value; the element will only be visible when the formula evaluates to `true`

## How show/hide differs from CSS display

Using Nordcraft's show/hide formula is different from setting CSS `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`:

- **Show/hide formula:**
  - Completely removes and unmounts the element from the DOM when hidden
  - Adds a new instance of the component or element to the DOM when shown and reinitializes state
  - No APIs, events or workflows run on hidden elements
- **CSS display/visibility:**
  - The element or component remains in the DOM but is not visible
  - APIs, events and workflows continue to run
  - No unmounting or remounting occurs when toggling visibility

## Performance considerations

Given elements are unmounted and remounted when the show/hide condition changes, be aware of these performance implications:

- **Re-initialization**: When an element is added to the DOM when the show/hide formula evalutes to truthy, all initializations, API calls and `onLoad` events will run again
- **DOM updates**: Hiding and showing elements forces the browser to remove and recreate DOM nodes, which can negatively affect page performance for complex components
- **State loss**: Any internal state not stored in variables will reset when the element is hidden

For most uses, this behavior is ideal. However, if you need to toggle visibility frequently while maintaining state, consider CSS alternatives:

- Use `display: none` to hide the element but preserve its state
- Use `visibility: hidden` to hide the element while maintaining its layout space

::: warning
Hiding and showing elements and components via CSS keep their markup in the DOM, so use this approach only when you need to preserve state during frequent visibility changes.
