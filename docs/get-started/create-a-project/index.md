# Create a new project in Nordcraft

In Nordcraft, you can create an [app](/get-started/overview#apps) or a [package](/get-started/overview#packages). An app is a standalone website or web app, while packages are used to bundle up smaller bits of reusable functionality to use in Nordcraft apps.

## Create a project from the dashboard

In the dashboard view, find the **Start Building** section. Click [kbd]Create project[kbd]. On the next screen you'll choose whether to create an app or a package.

## Create a project from the organization view

In the organization view, at the top right of the project list, find the button to create a project.

## Create an app

First, pick a template to start from. Choose a basic blank template, a Nordcraft template, or a template built by the community.

1. **Select organization**: Pre-selected based on your account settings
2. **Project info**:
   - Add a project name
   - The project ID is auto generated, you may wish to edit it before creating the project
3. **Choose visibility**: Decide who should be able to see your app; select **public** or **private**

Click `Create project` and the Nordcraft editor will open for you to start working.

## Create a package

To create a package, click the `Create package` button at the top right of the template selection screen. This will open a dialog for you to configure your package details.

For more detailed instructions on packages, see the [creating and launching packages](/packages/creating-and-launching) guide.

## Visibility options

When creating a project you can choose between two visibility options:

- **Public**: Your project will be visible and clonable via a URL, but others cannot edit it
- **Private**: Your project is only visible within your organization, with customizable access and roles for different users

::: info
Private apps require a paid plan.
It is currently not possible to create private packages.
