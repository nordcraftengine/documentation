# Packages

Packages extend your Nordcraft projects with reusable components and functionality. They help you save development time and maintain consistency across projects.

::: dev
Packages in Nordcraft work similar to NPM packages. They can contain pure logic, visual elements or both.

![The packages list is open to the left of the editor, showing information about the confetti back to the right. Visible is the package name, author, launch date and description, including a demo video and an interactive on-page demo. At the top right there are options to clone, star and install the package.|16/9](packages.webp 'Package overview')

## Browsing packages

You can find the [kbd]packages[kbd] button in the [left sidebar](/the-editor/overview#left-panel). The packages panel organizes available packages into three tabs:

- **Popular**: Most frequently installed packages
- **Newest**: Recently published packages
- **Installed**: Packages currently used in your project

Use the search bar to find specific packages.

You can give a star to packages you find useful by clicking the star icon next to the [kbd]install[kbd] button. Stars contribute to the package's ranking in the Popular tab.

- All packages can be cloned to learn from or modify
