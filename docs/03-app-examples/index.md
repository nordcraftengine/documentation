## App examples

Explore a variety of projects built in Nordcraft, from small toy projects to full platforms in production.

## The Nordcraft Editor

The Nordcraft Editor is built in Nordcraft itself. If you can build an editor within an editor, you can build anything.

## A drum machine

t-beat pro is a drum machine built in Nordcraft using the WebAudio API. Choose your drum sound and BPM, and build a looping beat that goes on forever (or until you stop it).
