## App examples

Explore a variety projects built in Nordcraft, from small toy projects to full platforms in production.

## The Nordcraft Editor

The Nordcraft Editor is built in Nordcraft itself. If you can build an editor within and editor, you can build anything.

## A drum machine

t-beat pro is a drum machine built in Nordcraft using the WebAudio API. Choose your drum sound and BPM, and build a looping beat that goes on forever (or until you stop it).

## A CSS-only clock

This is a fully-functioning clock built with just CSS and no JavaScript, complete with support for multiple timezones.

The label above the clock says Copenhagen, and there are links below the clock to switch the time display to New York, Copenhagen and London.
