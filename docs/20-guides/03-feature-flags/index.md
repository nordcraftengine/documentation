# Feature flags

If you enjoy testing beta features in software, you may like to try out some of Nordcraft's experimental features and provide feedback to the team about your experience in the [Nordcraft Discord](https://discord.gg/nordcraft).

To enable experimental features:

1. Sign in to your Nordcraft account
2. Navigate to the [feature flags](https://app.nordcraft.com/flags) page
3. Accept the disclaimer
4. Toggle any features you would like to enable or disable
5. Refresh the Nordcraft editor in your browser to apply any changes

## Warning

:::danger
**Do not enable flags on projects that are live in production.**

Experimental features are not fully developed, and enabling these features via the feature flags page is for testing purposes only. Enabling feature flags may cause data loss or Nordcraft editor issues. If you experience any issues when enabling feature flags, turn them off to continue working.

**Proceed with caution.**
